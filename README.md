# Starting with GitHub Api Test

This project fethces some stuff from GitHub's Rest Api (documented [here](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/rest)). It is meant to be just a short assignment, but I wanted to try out initiating some stuff that I have been using in already existing projects (e.g. not sure if Redux-Saga was really needed here, but it was interesting to try it out). 

## How to get started

The app is already running in Azure, you can just check it out [here](https://githubapistorage.z6.web.core.windows.net/).
If you want to run the code locally, just run `yarn install` and `yarn start` in the project directory, and the app will be opened in [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

You can run tests with `yarn test`.
